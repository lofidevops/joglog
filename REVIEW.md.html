       Jog Log, a REST API that tracks the jogging times of users.

This is a reduced set of user acceptance tests to help guide the
demonstration. Each step should succeed unambiguously. Every action is
made as a raw request-response, with the REST Framework GUI serving as
a link-driven client. We will use the "Raw data" field to submit
JSON text (rather than individual GUI fields).

# User creation

## Anonymous registration

* Start logged out.
* Note that you cannot access the session or report lists (403 forbidden).
* Click on the user list.
* Scroll to the bottom and open the "Raw data" tab.
* Note that you cannot register as a superuser. Attempting to POST the
  following JSON block will fail:

```
{
    "username": "bigboots",
    "password": "secret",
    "is_staff": true,
    "is_superuser": true
}
```

* But trying to register as a regular user (jogger) will succeed:

```
{
    "username": "justdoit",
    "password": "secret",
    "is_staff": false,
    "is_superuser": false
}
```

* You can now click on "Log in" and use your new credentials.

## Change password

* As a logged in jogger, note that you can see the list of users, but
  you cannot access their individual links (403 forbidden).
* Visit your user own link.
* Click on the "Raw data" tab and PUT the following JSON block to
  change your password:

```
{
    "username": "justdoit",
    "password": "verysecret",
    "is_staff": false,
    "is_superuser": false
}
```

* Log out and in again to confirm that the change was successful.

## As a superuser, create a staff user

* Log in as `superuser` with the password `password`.
* Note that you now have access to the session, user and report lists,
  and can see all data.
* Go to the user list and POST the following JSON block:

```
{
    "username": "themanager",
    "password": "secret",
    "is_staff": true,
    "is_superuser": false
}
```

## As a staff user, create a jogger

* Log in with the staff credentials above.
* Note that you do not have access to the session and report lists.
* Go to the user list and POST the JSON block (below).
* Note the user number (ID) of the new user.

```
{
    "username": "theflash",
    "password": "secret",
    "is_staff": false,
    "is_superuser": false
}
```

# Session management

## Log multiple jogging sessions

* Log in as `theflash` with the password `secret`. (Or any other
  jogger account where you know the ID.)
* Note that you have access to the session and report links, but
  they are empty because you don't have any data yet.
* Go to the session list and POST these JSON blocks (below).
* Note that speed, weather and calendar week are calculated /
  retrieved on your behalf.

**Week 22**

}
```

## Delete a session

* Go back to the list of sessions.
* Confirm that you can delete the last session (2020-06-04).

## Filter by user

* Go to the session list.
* Append the following to the URL, where `X` is your user ID.

```
?filter=speed lt 1.0
```

* Confirm that only sessions below 1 km/h appear.

## Use a complex filter

* Go to the session list.
* Append the following to the URL:

```
?filter=speed lt 1.0 and (distance lt 20 or start lte '2020-05-27')
```

* Confirm that the correct sessions appear: 2020-05-28 and 2020-05-26

# Reporting

* With the same jogging account, visit the report link.
* Confirm the following values for Week 22:

   * Total distance: 21 + 20 + 19 = 60 m
   * Total duration: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 mins
   * Average speed: 60 / 6, convert units = 0.6 km/h

* Confirm the following values for Week 23:

   * Total distance: 40 + 40 = 80 m
   * Total duration: 2 + 2 = 4 mins
   * Average speed: 80 / 4, convert units = 1.2 km/h
