# Version history

This is a living document. The version history provides a high-level
summary of changes and highlights in each version. A version may be in
draft, submitted or approved.

## Initial version (approved)

First version, covering all areas. "Logic and validation" contains
important out-of-scope definitions. The format and filtering for
location and weather has been only roughly defined, pending
implementation details.

## Implementation updates I (submitted)

1. Calendar week will be calculated using ISO 8601 and stored as a YYYYWW integer.
2. `dn_speed` is rounded to one decimal place.
3. Updated location and weather fields to final session definition.
4. Removed `is_in_report` and `is_active` fields, not in original spec.
5. Highlighted user creation rules (anonymous user can register).
6. Noted that the system supports users changing their passwords.
7. Provide JSON serialization for user and session.
8. Listed supported filter tokens. Noted rules for literals.
9. Added a note that minor validation issues are recorded in the codebase, not this document.
10. Highlight that for convenience we will use the Django REST GUI for convenience,
    and additionally demonstrate that the system follows the RESTful request/response pattern.

## Implementation updates II (submitted)

*Final review before demonstration. No significant changes are expected.*

1. Update weekly report columns to match implementation. Does not include a session
   count. Includes distance, duration and speed fields. Updated associated filter docs.
2. Making sure all queries and fields are correct / reflected in implementation.
3. Created REVIEW.md.html for (light) acceptance testing.

# User story

I am a jogger. I want to log my daily jogging sessions, so that I can
later review my performance statistics.

## Weekly performance report

Reports on average statistics for user sessions in a calendar week.
Note that the average is calculated with the *total distance* and
*total duration* over the *days in the week*. So missed/skipped days
do not lower the average.

Sample:

| User | Week   | Distance | Duration | Avg. speed |
| ---- | ------ | -------- | -------- | ---------- |
| 2    | 202019 | 5        | 2        | 2.5        |
| 2    | 202020 | 15       | 3        | 5.0        |
| 2    | 202022 | 3        | 2        | 1.5        |

# Interface

All actions will take place via a RESTful API. The interface
must work without a browser-based GUI.

We will use the Django REST GUI for demonstration purposes.
For each query we will demonstrate that the system functions
without the GUI (a RESTful query URL generating raw JSON output).

# Roles and permissions

## Jogger

A jogger can sign up for an account, and manage their own session
logs. They cannot access or manage other users' data.

## Manager

A manager can manage all jogger accounts. They cannot access or
manage any session logs. A manager account must be created by an
administrator.

## Administrator

An administrator can manage any record, including joggers' session
logs. They can create jogger, manager or administrator accounts.

## Supported actions

The following actions will be supported:

| Role       | Record  | Action  | Notes              |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| Anonymous  | User    | Create  | Registration.      |
| Jogger     | User    | CRUD    | Own user only.     |
| Jogger     | Session | CRUD    | Own sessions only. |
| Jogger     | Report  | Read    | Own sessions only. |
| Manager    | User    | CRUD    | Joggers only.      |
| Admin      | User    | CRUD    | All user types.    |
| Admin      | Session | CRUD    | All users.         |
| Admin      | Report  | Read    | All users.         |

All users will be able to change their own password. Managers
can override jogger passwords. Admins can override jogger
and manager passwords.

# Session record

## Overview

The session log is the core record, summarised in the table below.
Fields are required unless otherwise specified. Additional notes are
indicated with an asterisk and expanded on below.

| Field               | Type     | Unit     | Notes        |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| url                 | URL      |          | Contains ID. Clickable. |
| start               | Datetime | UTC      | Captured to nearest minute. |
| dn_week             | Integer  | YYYYWW   | Denormalised. * |
| local_timezone      | String   | tzdb     | Optional. Default blank. * |
| distance            | Integer  | Meters   | |
| duration            | Integer  | Minutes  | |
| lu_weather_location | String   | *        | Optional. Default blank. |
| lu_weather          | String   | *        | May be blank.   |
| dn_speed            | Decimal  | km/h     | Denormalised. * |
| user                | URL       |         | Foreign key. |

## JSON input format

```
{
    "user": X,  # replace X with user ID
    "start": "2020-05-29T01:01",  # note time format
    "local_timezone": "Europe/London",
    "distance": 5,
    "duration": 3,
    "lu_weather_location": "London,UK",
    "user": 1  # user ID
}
```

## Additional field notes

### local_timezone

The local timezone is recorded in tzdb/Olson format. It may be set by
the user, the client or it may be blank. The system does not validate
this value. It is the responsibility of the JSON consumer to display
the time using the local timezone.

### lu_weather_location

User-based city name for weather lookup. If blank or not recognised,
no weather result will be stored.

### lu_weather

Summary of weather conditions: clear, cloudy, precipitation or other.

This is a lookup (lu) value taken from an external service and stored
locally for convenience. The lookup be performed again at any time.

### dn_speed

This field stores the speed in km/h of the current session, rounded to
one decimal place. This value is **not** used in the weekly average
calculation.

This is a derived value stored in a denormalised (dn) field for
convenience. It can be recalculated at any time.

The formula is:

```
distance_km = distance / 1000
duration_h = duration / 60
speed = round((distance_km / duration_h), 0.1)
```

### dn_week

This field stores the ISO 8601 calendar week of the current date. Calendar
weeks are numbered 1--52 (sometimes 53), starting around January 1 of the
current year. A week starts on a Monday.

For more detail see [The Mathematics of the ISO 8601 Calender](https://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~gent0113/calendar/isocalendar.htm)
and the Python standard library [date.isocalendar()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#datetime.date.isocalendar)
definition.

For convenience, the week is expressed as an integer value, for example
`202001` or `202013`.

This is a derived value stored in a denormalised (dn) field for
convenience. It can be recalculated at any time.

## Logic and validation

The following additional restrictions and assumptions are made:

### Check for a maximum of one session per calendar day

We check that only one session is made per UTC calendar day. If the
user attempts to create an additional session on the same day, the
system will return an error.

### Assume sessions do not overlap

We assume that sessions do not overlap. The system will not detect if
the user creates sessions that overlap (for example, a three-hour
session starts at 23.00 on day 1, and a second session starts at 1.00
on day 2.)

### Assume session data is plausible

We assume session data is plausible. For example, the system will not
detect if the jogger runs at impossible speeds.

### Assume location data is coherent

We assume that the location and local timezone are coherent. The system
will not detect if the user captures an invalid location/timezone pair.

### Minor validation issues recorded in the codebase

Other validation issues considered minor are not recorded here. They are
implemented, documented and tested in the codebase. For example,
validating that the distance travelled is not negative.

# Other records

Other records will use default Django mechanisms. For example:

* The User model for user accounts. JSON input format:

```
{
    "username": "joggingfan99",
    "password": "**********",  # plaintext input, encrypted output
    "is_staff": false,
    "is_superuser": false
}
```

* Manager accounts are indicated by Django's `is_staff` flag.

* The first administrator account will be created with Django's
  `createsuperuser` function.

# Queries

## Filter format

Filters will take the form of:

```
http://.../?filter=EXPRESSION
```

...where EXPRESSION is a human-readable infix function with field names
available as variables. For example:

```
http://.../?filter=start lt '2020-06-01' or (speed gt 0.2 and lu_weather ne 'CLEAR')
```

## Operators, literals and evaluations

The following filter operators are available:

| Operator    | Meaning   |
| ----------- | --------- |
| `eq`        | equal     |
| `ne`        | not equal |
| `lt`        | less than |
| `lte`       | less than or equal |
| `gt`        | greater than |
| `gte`       | greater than or equal |

Literals must be encoded as follows:

| Type    | Example      |
| ------- | ------------ |
| String  | 'value'      |
| Decimal | 10.0         |
| Date    | '1999-12-31' |
| Week    | 202013       |

The following fields will be available to query on:

| Field          | Type     | Unit     | Notes        |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| start          | Datetime | UTC      | `yyyy-mm-dd` format for filter. |
| dn_week        | Integer  | YYYYWW   | |
| local_timezone | String   | | |
| distance       | Integer  | Meters   | |
| duration       | Integer  | Minutes  | |
| dn_speed       | Decimal  | km/h     | |
| lu_weather_location | String | -     | String query. |
| lu_weather     | String   | -        | Filter by clear/cloudy/precipitation/other |
| user           | ID       |          | Administrator may query on other IDs. |

## Users

The following fields will be available to query on:

| Field          | Type        | Unit    | Notes        |
| -------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------------ |
| username       | String      |         | |
| role           | Enum        |         | Filter by jogger/staff/administrator |

### Filter by role

There is no single "role" field, but users will be able to query as
though there were.

## Report

The following fields will be available to query on:

| Field          | Type     | Unit    | Notes        |
| -------------- | -------- | ------- | ------------ |

| duration       | Integer  | mins    | |
| avg_speed      | Decimal  | km/h    | Average of the above. |

The results will resemble the report defined at the beginning of this
document.

# Non-functional requirements

1. The system should include automated, passing unit tests.

2. The system should include automated, passing end-to-end tests.

3. It should be possible to demonstrate the system via screen-sharing.

There are no other non-functional requirements (performance,
scaling...) for this deliverable.
